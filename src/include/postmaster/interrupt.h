 * interrupt.h
 *	  Inter-process interrupts
 *
 * "Interrupts" are a set of flags that represent conditions that should be
 * handled at a later time.  They are roughly analogous to Unix signals,
 * except that they are handled cooperatively by checking for them at many
 * points in the code.
 *
 * Interrupt flags can be "raised" synchronously by code that wants to defer
 * an action, or asynchronously by timer signal handlers, other signal
 * handlers or "sent" by other backends setting them directly.
 *
 * Most code currently deals with the INTERRUPT_GENERAL interrupt. It is
 * raised by any of the events checked by CHECK_FOR_INTERRUPTS(), like query
 * cancellation or idle session timeout. Well behaved backend code performs
 * CHECK_FOR_INTERRUPTS() periodically in long computations, and should never
 * sleep using mechanisms other than the WaitEventSet mechanism or the more
 * convenient WaitInterrupt/WaitSockerOrInterrupt functions (except for
 * bounded short periods, eg LWLock waits), so they should react in good time.
 *
 * The "standard" set of interrupts is handled by CHECK_FOR_INTERRUPTS(), and
 * consists of tasks that are safe to perform at most times.  They can be
 * suppressed by HOLD_INTERRUPTS()/RESUME_INTERRUPTS().
 *
 *
 * The correct pattern to wait for event(s) using INTERRUPT_GENERAL is:
 *
 * for (;;)
 * {
 *	   ClearInterrupt(INTERRUPT_GENERAL);
 *	   if (work to do)
 *		   Do Stuff();
 *	   WaitInterrupt(INTERRUPT_GENERAL, ...);
 * }
 *
 * It's important to clear the interrupt *before* checking if there's work to
 * do. Otherwise, if someone sets the interrupt between the check and the
 * ClearInterrupt() call, you will miss it and Wait will incorrectly block.
 *
 * Another valid coding pattern looks like:
 *
 * for (;;)
 * {
 *	   if (work to do)
 *		   Do Stuff(); // in particular, exit loop if some condition satisfied
 *	   WaitInterrupt(INTERRUPT_GENERAL, ...);
 *	   ClearInterrupt(INTERRUPT_GENERAL);
 * }
 *
 * This is useful to reduce interrupt traffic if it's expected that the loop's
 * termination condition will often be satisfied in the first iteration; the
 * cost is an extra loop iteration before blocking when it is not.  What must
 * be avoided is placing any checks for asynchronous events after
 * WaitInterrupt and before ClearInterrupt, as that creates a race condition.
 *
 * To wake up the waiter, you must first set a global flag or something else
 * that the wait loop tests in the "if (work to do)" part, and call
 * SendInterrupt(INTERRUPT_GENERAL) *after* that. SendInterrupt is designed to
 * return quickly if the interrupt is already set. In more complex scenarios
 * with nested loops that can consume different events, you can define your
 * own INTERRUPT_* flag instead of relying on INTERRUPT_GENERAL.
